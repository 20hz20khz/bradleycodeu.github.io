Create a two player racing game. When left is pressed, **rotate to the left**. When right is pressed, **rotate right**. When up is pressed **move forward** in whatever direction you are facing.

Slow a player down if they are touching the green grass.

Players must **NOT** be able to simply turn around and touch the finish line. You must do *something* to prevent this.

Make three new sprites:
- a finish line
- text that says "Player 1 wins"
- text that says "Player 2 wins"

When a player touches the finish line, display EITHER "Player 1 wins" or "Player 2 wins" and then stop the game.
