**PICK TWO SHAPES**:
  - Sphere
  - Right Circular Cylinder
  - Right Circular Cone
  - Frustrum of a Cone (aka Conical Frustum)
  - Square Pyramid
  - Torus
  - Regular Tetrahedron

(NOTE: You can NOT do Cube, Prism, or Cuboid/Rectangular Solid)


Create four functions that will __calculate and return__:
  1.  the volume of shape 1
  1.  surface area of shape 1
  1.  volume of shape 2
  1.  surface area of shape 2

Directions:
- Create a label for your first three-dimensional shape
  - Create entries (input boxes) for any required variables (radius, height, side, slant, etc)
  - Create a button that says "Calculate 1" and when clicked runs the calculateOne function.
  - Define a calculateOne function that:
    - collects the variables for shape 1
    - calls the functions that return the volume of shape 1 and surface area of shape 1
    - display a messagebox that tells the user the volume and surface area of shape 1
- Create a label for your second three-dimensional shape
  - Create entries (input boxes) for any required variables (radius, height, side, slant, etc)
  - Create a button that says "Calculate 2" and when clicked runs the calculateTwo function.
  - Define a calculateTwo function that:
    - collects the variables for shape 2
    - calls the functions that return the volume of shape 2 and surface area of shape 2
    - display a messagebox that tells the user the volume and surface area of shape 2
