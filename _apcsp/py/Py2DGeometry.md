**PICK TWO SHAPES**:
  - Triangle
  - Regular Pentagon
  - Regular Hexagon
  - Regular Heptagon
  - Regular Octagon
  - Circle

(NOTE: You can NOT do Square or Rectangle)

Create four functions that will __calculate and return__:
  1.  the area of shape 1
  1.  perimeter of shape 1
  1.  area shape 2
  1.  perimeter of shape 2


Directions:
- Create a label for your first shape
  - Create entries (input boxes) for any required variables (base, height, side 1, side 2, etc)
  - Create a button that says "Calculate 1" and when clicked runs the calculateOne function.
  - Define a calculateOne function that:
    - collects the variables for shape 1
    - calls the functions that return the volume of shape 1 and surface area of shape 1
    - display a messagebox that tells the user the volume and surface area of shape 1
- Create a label for your second three-dimensional shape
  - Create entries (input boxes) for any required variables (radius, height, side, slant, etc)
  - Create a button that says "Calculate 2" and when clicked runs the calculateTwo function.
  - Define a calculateTwo function that:
    - collects the variables for shape 2
    - calls the functions that return the volume of shape 2 and surface area of shape 2
    - display a messagebox that tells the user the volume and surface area of shape 2
