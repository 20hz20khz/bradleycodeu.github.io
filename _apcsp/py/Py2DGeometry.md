**PICK TWO SHAPES**:
  - Triangle
  - Regular Pentagon
  - Regular Hexagon
  - Regular Heptagon
  - Regular Octagon
  - Circle

(NOTE: You can NOT do Square or Rectangle)


Directions:
- Define four functions that will *calculate and return*:
    1.  the area of shape 1
    1.  perimeter of shape 1
    1.  area shape 2
    1.  perimeter of shape 2
- Define a calculateOne function that:
    - collects the variables for shape 1
    - calls the functions that return the area of shape 1 and perimeter of shape 1
    - display a messagebox that tells the user the area and perimeter of shape 1
- Define a calculateTwo function that:
    - collects the variables for shape 2
    - calls the functions that return the area of shape 2 and perimeter of shape 2
    - display a messagebox that tells the user the area and perimeter of shape 2
- Create a label for your first shape
- Create entries (input boxes) for any required variables (base, height, side 1, side 2, etc)
- Create a button that says "Calculate Shape 1" and when clicked runs the calculateOne function.
- Create a label for your second shape
- Create entries (input boxes) for any required variables (radius, height, side, slant, etc)
- Create a button that says "Calculate Shape 2" and when clicked runs the calculateTwo function.
