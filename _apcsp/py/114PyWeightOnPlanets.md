title: Weight On Planets
---
On planet Earth, gravity has a value of 9.81 N/Kg (Newtons per kilogram). Because the Moon has about one-sixth of the gravity that Earth does, you would weigh less standing on it. On the Moon, gravity has a value of 1.622 N/Kg.

We can hence use the following formula to calculate your weight on the Moon:
![Weight on the Moon formula](/apcsp/py/weight-on-the-Moon-formula.png)


Calculate and output the weight of the end-user on *one* of the following planets (NOT the moon):

| Planet | Gravity (in N/Kg) |
|----|----|
| Mercury | 	3.7 |
| Venus | 	8.87 |
| Mars | 	3.711 |
| Jupiter | 	24.79 |
| Saturn | 	10.44 |
| Uranus | 	8.69 |
| Neptune | 	11.15 |


You will:
- Collect the user's weight in pounds
- Validate the number
- Convert pounds to kilograms
- Calculate their weight on another planets
- Convert kilograms to pounds
- Create a popup that tells the user "Your weight on *whatever planet* is ___ lbs"
