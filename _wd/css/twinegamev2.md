Must have:

- A customized Stylesheet (you must make unique changes to the CSS)
- 25 or more passages

- 2 or more choices in each passage (for example... You hear a loud banging at the front door. [[Run and hide]] or [[See who is there]] )

Finally, select "Publish To File" from the bottom-left Twine menu. Save the file as "index.html" and upload it to a new Glitch project. Turn in the Glitch URL.
