title: Multi-page Pizza Site 2
---

For this project you will continue working on your multi-page pizza site with the same group of 2-4 people. Each person will add ONE new page (with an h1, text, and image) to the site.

The FINAL number of pages in the project is determined by the number of people:
  - 2 people = index.html homepage plus 4 other pages (add 2 new pages)
  - 3 people = index.html homepage plus 6 other pages (add 3 new pages)
  - 4 people = index.html homepage plus 8 other pages (add 4 new pages)

Ideas for "other pages" include: Pizzas, Wings, Pasta, Sides, Desserts, Drinks, Gift Cards, Deals, Our Locations, Our Story, Employment, Kids Club, Nutrition, Food Truck, Birthday Room, Contact Us

Your website MUST have a consistent style across all other pages:
      1. same navigation system (like a nav bar) on all pages
      1. same colorful background (not black or white) on all pages
      1. same colorful text (not black or white) on all pages
