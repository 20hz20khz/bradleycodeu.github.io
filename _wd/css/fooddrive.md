Home - About Us - Mission - Donate - Volunteer - Contact Us

Welcome to the home page for the Community Food Drive! Please Help! Our food banks are excited to have you join the fight against hunger in your community. Keep these things in mind in order to have the greatest impact. Before you organize a food drive, make sure you contact your local food bank. The food bank will give you advice.

We maintain the highest standards of food safety, which means that not every product is suitable for donation. It requires time and effort for the food bank to sort and inspect all donated items to ensure that they are safe. To maximize your efforts, we suggest that you also consider a “virtual” food drive to help support your local food bank.



ABOUT US

--- Insert a photo of a "community center" here ---

Our annual food drive takes place annually. This event is the largest one-day food drive in the metropolitan area and has helped feed those in need since 1991. We strive to provide the most nutritious food for individuals and families in our community. If you are unable to bring items to the food bank at 2828 North Central Avenue, please consider giving a cash donation. For every dollar that you donate, our food bank can buy $12 worth of food using wholesale discounts.

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
