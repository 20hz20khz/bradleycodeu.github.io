Watch this video about how [Simpler is Better](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hpUxydU5K0Lv9N_UkXRrQDSfIBxV8RAp) in web design.

Using [codecast.me](http://codecast.me/launch), create a simple webpage (for a business, sports team, school club, rock band, etc) with a Title, Heading (H1), and three simple details in normal text on three separate lines (motto or slogan, fake phone number, fake building address, fake email, fake store hours, etc).

Use the [center tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_center.asp) to center text on the page. Later, we will learn how to center text using CSS instead.

If you know how, you *may* add an image/logo for your business, sports team, school club, rock band, etc.
