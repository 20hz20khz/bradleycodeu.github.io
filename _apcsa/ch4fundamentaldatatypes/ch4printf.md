Here is a [Java printf Quick Reference](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~cs160/.Summer16/resources/Java_printf_method_quick_reference.pdf)

```
double foo = 27.5, bar = 33.7999999999987349873459873565;
System.out.printf("x = %10.2f and y = %10.2f", foo, bar);
```
will output...
```
x =      27.50 and y =      33.80
```

Write a program that produces the following output. All display lines MUST use printf()!!!

![printf example](/apcsa\ch4fundamentaldatatypes\printfexample.png)
